FixComments
===========

Description
-----------

This project provides a work-around for Excel's "wandering comments" bug.  Specifically, the VBA code in this project sets the dimensions and locations of all comments to hard-coded values whenever the workbook is saved.  As a result, comment dimensions are kept reasonable, and comments stay located near their parent cells.
